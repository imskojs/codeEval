### Learn TypeScript by solving toy problems


Solving toy problems is quite fun, but I was always annoyed by the fact that the code I have used in solving one problem can't be used in other problems unless I copy-paste-it.

This project uses typescript and gulp-replace-task to embed actual code into the .ts
file allowing us to extend classes used to successfuly answer other problems.  

Let's COMPOSE!
